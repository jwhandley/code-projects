      EQWLTH             Should govt reduce income differences

           74a. Some people think that the government in Washington ought
           to reduce the income differences between the rich and the poor,
           perhaps by raising the taxes of wealthy families or by giving
           income assistance to the poor. Others think that the government
           should not concern itself with reducing this income difference
           between the rich and the poor. Here is a card with a scale from
           1 to 7. Think of a score of 1 as meaning that the government
           ought to reduce the income differences between rich and poor,
           and a score of 7 meaning that the government should not concern
           itself with reducing income differences. What score between 1
           and 7 comes closest to the way you feel?
