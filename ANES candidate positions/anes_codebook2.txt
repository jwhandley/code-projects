           GENERAL NOTE:
           See Appendix 'INCOME' for income ranges corresponding to these
           percentiles.
           Study coding of income was approximated as closely as possible to fit
           within this version.  Prior to 1972, this was an estimate of CURRENT
           year's income; since 1972, PREVIOUS year's income.  NOTE that in all
           years beginning 1976 this question was not actually asked if R was the
           only household member age 14 or over: in such cases, data from the
           question asking R's own income was duplicated. (Prior to 1976 R's
           own income was not determined.)
           Beginning in 1964, R was shown a respondent card or booklet.
           1948 NOTE:
           Question wording was undocumented.

           1960 NOTE:
           Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from
           these forms were incorporated.
           1996 NOTE:
           For 14 cases, interviewers entered responses where individual income
           was higher than family income.  In some of these cases, the responses
           for family income and R income may have been provided.entered in
           incorrect order.
           1998 NOTE:
           Some interviewers coded lowest income category when the respondent
           stated that he or she did not know what the household income was.
           Study staff has reviewed all interviewer comment material available to
           identify cases coded in the lowest category where comment NOTEs clearly

           GENERAL NOTE:
           See also VCF0129 and VCF0152.
           In all Pre-Post studies except 1960 this was a Pre var.
           This has been collapsed from the Study variable summarizing R's
           religious self-identification, constructed from the complete set of
           questions asked, usually including questions additional to those
           documented here (see questions per VCF0128b,VCF0129).
           1990-later (exc. 2002) NOTE:
           Questions about religious affiliation were preceded by the filter
           question, 'Lots of things come up that keep people from attending
           religious services even if they want to.
           Thinking about your life these days, do you ever attend religious
           services, apart from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?'
           (SEE VCF0130), which had some effect on distributions.
           1948 NOTE:
           Question wording was undocumented.
           1992 NOTE:
           This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
           form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.

      VCF9084            CANDIDATES: Democratic Presidential Cand- Aid to Blacks Scale

           1972,1976,1980,1984 and 1988 FORM B:
           Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every
           (1972, 1976: possible) effort to improve the social and economic
           position of blacks and other minority groups (1988 B: other minorities)
           (1980: even if it means giving the preferential treatment). Others feel
           that the government should not make any special effort to help
           minorities because they should help themselves.
           1988 Form A, 1996 AND LATER:
           Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every
           effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks. Others
           feel that the government should not make any special effort to help
           blacks because they should help themselves.

      VCF9085            CANDIDATES: Democratic Presidential Cand- Government Health Insurance Scale

           There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
           costs. Some feel there should be a government insurance plan which
           would cover all medical and hospital expenses. Others feel that
           medical expenses should be paid by individuals, and through private
           insurance like Blue Cross.

      VCF9088            CANDIDATES: Democratic Presidential Cand- Liberal-Conservative Scale

           We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
           Here is a 7-point scale on which the political views that people might
           hold are arranged from extremely liberal to extremely conservative.
           Where would you place [the Democratic Presidential Candidate] on this
           scale? (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

           VALID CODES:

           In 1996 and later, randomization occurred for the order of the major
           Presidential candidate names for this placement.
           In 1972-1980, if R replied DK or 'haven't thought much about it' in
           rating self on same 7-point scale, then R was not asked this question.
           [ NOTE that in 1972-1982 there was no follow-up question ('if you had to
           choose.') for self-rating.]
           In 1984,1988,1992, if R's self-placement was NA on the 7-point scale,
           then this question was not asked.  If R  replied 'haven't thought much
           about it' or DK to this same 7-point scale, then R was prompted, 'If
           you had to choose...'  If R's response to the follow-up in 1984-1992
           was DK, RF or NA, then R was not asked this question.
           1972 NOTE:
           Respondents in Post mail sample were not asked this question.
           1980 NOTE:
           In 1980, this question appeared in both the Pre and Post; Pre data are
           included here.

      VCF9092            CANDIDATES: Republican Presidential Cand- Aid to Blacks Scale

           1972,1976,1980,1984 and 1988 FORM B:
           Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every
           (1972, 1976: possible) effort to improve the social and economic
           position  of blacks and other minority groups (1988 B: other minorities)
           (1980: even if it means giving the preferential treatment). Others feel
           that the government should not make  any special effort to help
           minorities because they should help themselves.
           1988 Form A, 1996 AND LATER:
           Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every
           effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks. Others
           feel that the government should not make any special effort to help
           blacks because they should help themselves.

           There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
           costs. Some feel there should be a government insurance plan which
           would cover all medical and hospital expenses. Others feel that
           medical expenses should be paid by individuals, and through private
           insurance like Blue Cross.

      VCF9096            CANDIDATES: Republican Presidential Cand- Liberal-Conservative Scale

           We hear a lot of talk these days about liberals and conservatives.
           Here is a 7-point scale on which the political views that people might
           hold are arranged from extremely liberal to extremely conservative.
           Where would you place [the Republican Presidential Candidate] on this
           scale? (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

           1988,1992; Dole 1996; George W. Bush 2000.
           In 1996 and later, randomization occurred for the order of the major
           Presidential candidate names for this placement.
           In 1972-1980, if R replied DK or 'haven't thought much about it' in
           rating self on same 7-point scale, then R was not asked this question.
           [ NOTE that in 1972-1982 there was no follow-up question ('if you had to
           choose.') for self-rating.]
           In 1984,1988,1992, if R's self-placement was NA on the 7-point scale,
           then this question was not asked.  If R  replied 'haven't thought much
           about it' or DK to this same 7-point scale, then R was prompted, 'If
           you had to choose...'  If R's response to the follow-up in 1984-1992
           was DK, RF or NA, then R was not asked this question.
           1972 NOTE:
           Respondents in Post mail sample were not asked this question.
           1980 NOTE:
           In 1980, this question appeared in both the Pre and Post; Pre data are
           included here.

      VCF0702            ELECTION: Did Respondent Vote in the National Elections

           1948:
           In the election, about half the people voted and about half of
           them didn't.  Did you vote?
           1962:
           One of the things we need to know is whether or not people really did
           get to vote this fall.  In talking to people about the election we find
           that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't
           registered or they were sick or something else came up at the last
           minute.  Do you remember for sure whether or not you voted in the
           November election?
           1952-1960,1964-1998, 2002 VERSION 1, and 2004 VERSION 1:
           In talking to people about the election we (1972 AND LATER: often) find
           that a lot of people weren't able to vote because they weren't
           registered or they were sick or they just didn't have time. (1956-1960:
           How about you, did you vote this time?)  (1964-1970: How about you, did
           you vote this time, or did something keep you from voting) (1972-1976:
           How about you, did you vote in the elections this fall?) (1978 and
           later: How about you, did you vote in the elections this November?)
           2000, 2002 VERSION2, and 2004 VERSION 1: In talking to people about
           elections, we often find that a lot of people were not able to vote
           because they weren't registered, they were sick, or they just didn't
           have time.  Which of the following statements best describes you:
           One, I did not vote (in the election this November);
           Two, I thought about voting this time - but didn't;
           Three, I usually vote, but didn't this time; or
           Four, I am sure I voted?

           VALID CODES:

           1956 NOTE:
           Code 2 includes 3 cases from:  'Nonvoter, NA preference; voted, but not

           1982 NOTE:
           For congressional districts GA04 and GA05, an additional question
           appeared:  How about the special US Congressional elections held
           November 30th.  Did you vote in that election?  From 1982, code 2
           includes all GA04, GA05 respondents who voted in either the November 2
           general election or the November 30 special election, or both.
           2002 NOTE:
           Respondents were randomly assigned to either version 1 or version 2.

           is (1972,1974: I'm going to show you) a 7-point scale on which the
           political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely
           liberal to extremely conservative.
           Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
           much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)
           2000 TELEPHONE:
           When it comes to politics, do you usually think of yourself as extremely
           liberal, liberal, slightly liberal, moderate or middle of the road,

           question; except for years 1984, 1986 and 1990 this follow-up 'choice'
           question was also asked of respondents who answered 'moderate.'  For
           these years, a final 3-category summary was constructed:  the 'choice'
           question is found in VCF0824; the final 3-category summary is VCF0849.

      VCF0806            ISSUES: Government Health Insurance Scale

           There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
           costs.  Some (1988,1994-LATER: people) feel there should be a
           government insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital
           expenses (1984 AND LATER: for everyone).  (1996,2004: Suppose these
           people are at one end of a scale, at point 1). Others feel that
           (1988,1994-1996: all) medical expenses should be paid by individuals,
           and through private insurance (1984 AND LATER: plans) like Blue Cross
           (1984-1994: or [1996:some] other company paid plans). (1996,2004:
           Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.  And of course,
           some people have opinions somewhere in between at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.)
           Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
           much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

      VCF0809            ISSUES: Guaranteed Jobs and Income Scale

           Some people feel that the government in Washington should see to it
           that every person has a job and a good standard of living.  (1972-
           1978,1996-LATER: Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at
           point 1).  Others think the government should just let each person get
           ahead on his/their own. (1972-1978,1996: Suppose these people are at
           the other end, at point 7.  And, of course, some other people have
           opinions somewhere in between, at pints 2,3,4,5 or 6.)

           not make any special effort to help minorities because they should help
