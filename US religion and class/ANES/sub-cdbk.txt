            1966,1970:
            Many people don't know their exact (1966/1970) income yet; but would you
            tell me as best you can what you expect your (1966/1970) income to be--
            before taxes?  You may just tell me the letter of the group on this card
            into which your family income will probably fall.

            Please look at this card/page (2000 FTF: the booklet) and tell me the
            letter of the income group that includes the income of all members of
            your family living here in [previous year] before taxes.  This figure
            should include salaries, wages, pensions, dividends, interest, and all
            other income.  (IF UNCERTAIN:)  What would be your best guess?

            interest and all other income for every member of your family living in
            your house in 1991.  First could you tell me if that was above or below
            $24,999? (IF UNCERTAIN: what would be your best guess?) (IF ABOVE/BELOW
            $24,999:) I will read you some income categories, could you please stop
            me when I reach the category that corresponds to your family situation?
            2000 TELEPHONE:
            I am going to read you a list of income categories. Please tell me which
            category best describes the.total income of all members of your family

            doing financially these days. Your answers are confidential. Would you
            please give your best guess?

           ------
           GENERAL NOTE:
           See Appendix 'INCOME' for income ranges corresponding to these
           percentiles.
           Study coding of income was approximated as closely as possible to fit
           within this version.  Prior to 1972, this was an estimate of CURRENT
           year's income; since 1972, PREVIOUS year's income.  NOTE that in all
           years beginning 1976 this question was not actually asked if R was the
           only household member age 14 or over: in such cases, data from the
           question asking R's own income was duplicated. (Prior to 1976 R's
           own income was not determined.)
           Beginning in 1964, R was shown a respondent card or booklet.
           1948 NOTE:
           Question wording was undocumented.

           1960 NOTE:
           Personal data forms were completed for no-pre cases: data from
           these forms were incorporated.
           1996 NOTE:
           For 14 cases, interviewers entered responses where individual income
           was higher than family income.  In some of these cases, the responses
           for family income and R income may have been provided.entered in
           incorrect order.
           1998 NOTE:
           Some interviewers coded lowest income category when the respondent
           stated that he or she did not know what the household income was.
           Study staff has reviewed all interviewer comment material available to
           identify cases coded in the lowest category where comment NOTEs clearly
           indicate Don't Know; such cases have been recoded to DK.  However, it
           is not known whether there are additional DK cases (without recorded
           comments) for which lowest category had been incorrectly coded.
           2002 NOTE:
           Income categories were too broad for approximation here.
           2012 NOTE:
           Income range was included in the public release. Percentile group
           represents full (combined) 2012 sample, including both in-person
           (FTF) and Web respondents.
           2016 NOTE:
           Same as 2012.

           In all Pre-Post studies except 1960 this was a Pre var.
           This has been collapsed from the Study variable summarizing R's
           religious self-identification, constructed from the complete set of
           questions asked, usually including questions additional to those
           documented here (see questions per VCF0128b,VCF0129).
           1990-later (exc. 2002) NOTE:
           Questions about religious affiliation were preceded by the filter
           question, 'Lots of things come up that keep people from attending
           religious services even if they want to.
           Thinking about your life these days, do you ever attend religious
           services, apart from occasional weddings, baptisms or funerals?'

           The addition in 1972 of 'Is that Southern Baptist or something else?'
           significantly changed distributions of Protestant Baptists beginning in
           that year.
           Beginning in 1990 (except 2002), the full set of religion codes was
           expanded considerably, adding codes for different affiliations within
           the major mainline Protestant denominations and reworking almost
           entirely the Pentecostal, Holiness, fundamentalist, and evangelical
           Protestant denominations.  VCF0152 gives the 'new' set of full

           GENERAL NOTE:
           Beginning in 1990, question flow was reversed so that the religious
           attendance question preceded religious affiliation questions, whereas
           in previous studies religious attendance followed.  Beginning in 1990,
           frequency of religious attendance was preceded by a general attendance
           filter (yes/no); a 'no' response to the filter 1990 and later has been
           coded 5 here.
           1970 NOTE:
           Only codes corresponding to VCF0130 codes 2-5 were used (no code for
           'every week'). 'Almost every week' from 1970 has been recoded to 1,
           with no 1970 cases appearing in code 2.
           1992 NOTE:
           This question was not part of the 'short-form' questionnaire; for short-
           form panel cases, however, 1990 study data were incorporated.
           1994 NOTE:
           For Panel respondents,1992 data have been included.

           Lots of things come up that keep people from attending religious
           services even if they want to.  Thinking about your life these
           days, do you ever attend religious services, apart from occasional
           weddings, baptisms or funerals?  (IF YES: ) Do you go to religious
           services every week, almost every week, once or twice a month, a
           few times a year, or never?
           (IF R SAYS HE/SHE GOES TO RELIGIOUS SERVICES EVERY WEEK:)
           Would you say you go to religious services once a week or more often
           than once a week?

           is (1972,1974: I'm going to show you) a 7-point scale on which the
           political views that people might hold are arranged from extremely
           liberal to extremely conservative.
           Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
           much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

           For years 1984 and later, a follow-up 'choice' question was asked of
           respondents who replied 'don't know' or 'haven't thought much' to this
           question; except for years 1984, 1986 and 1990 this follow-up 'choice'
           question was also asked of respondents who answered 'moderate.'  For
           these years, a final 3-category summary was constructed:  the 'choice'
           question is found in VCF0824; the final 3-category summary is VCF0849.

           In addition to the traditional 7-point scale version of this question,

      VCF0806            ISSUES: Government Health Insurance Scale

           There is much concern about the rapid rise in medical and hospital
           costs.  Some (1988,1994-LATER: people) feel there should be a
           government insurance plan which would cover all medical and hospital
           expenses (1984 AND LATER: for everyone).  (1996,2004: Suppose these
           people are at one end of a scale, at point 1). Others feel that
           (1988,1994-1996: all) medical expenses should be paid by individuals,
           and through private insurance (1984 AND LATER: plans) like Blue Cross
           (1984-1994: or [1996:some] other company paid plans). (1996,2004:
           Suppose these people are at the other end, at point 7.  And of course,
           some people have opinions somewhere in between at points 2,3,4,5 or 6.)
           Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
           much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

           that every person has a job and a good standard of living.  (1972-
           1978,1996-LATER: Suppose these people are at one end of a scale, at
           point 1).  Others think the government should just let each person get
           ahead on his/their own. (1972-1978,1996: Suppose these people are at
           the other end, at point 7.  And, of course, some other people have
           opinions somewhere in between, at pints 2,3,4,5 or 6.)
           Where would you place yourself on this scale, or haven't you thought
           much about this?  (7-POINT SCALE SHOWN TO R)

           1970-1984,1986 FORM B, 1988 FORM B:
           Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every
           possible effort to improve the social and economic position of blacks
           (1970: Negroes) and other minority groups (1980: even if it means giving
           them preferential treatment).  Others feel that the government should
           not make any special effort to help minorities because they should help
           themselves (1970: but they should be expected to help themselves).
           1986 FORM A, 1988 FORM A, 1990 AND LATER:
           Some people feel that the government in Washington should make every
           (prior to 1996 only: possible) effort to improve the social and economic
           position of blacks. (1996-LATER: Suppose these people are at one end of
           a scale, at point 1). Others feel that the government should not make any
           special effort to help blacks because they should help themselves.
